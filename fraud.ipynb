    "Using a highly imbalanced dataset containing almost 300,000 transactions made by credit cards in Europe, the goal was to create a model that could reliably detect fraudulent transactions. F1-score was considered to be the most appropriate evaluation metric as it was assumed that both the cost of missing a fraudulent transaction (false negative), and the cost of correcting an incorrectly flagged fraudulent transaction (false positive) is high. A random forest classifier was built and hyperparameter tuned with bayesian optimization and stratified 5-fold cross-validation on a 80/20 split of training/test data. The f1-score on the test set was found to be 0.76. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall score can also be used if only the cost of false negatives is important. Tuning the model for recall instead of f1-score gives a recall score of 0.93 on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential improvements to the models are also discussed. "

    "The dataset provided by kaggle as explained above has 31 numeric features, 28 of which are principal components of the original dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to confidentiality reasons, the original dataset had principal components obtained through PCA and are represented through the features V1-V28. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction method. At its core, it utlizes linear algebra to reduce the amount of features in a dataset while doing its best preserve the information provided by them. Part of the process also minimizes collinearity which is further discussed later on. Because V1-V28 are principal components, we have lost all semantic meaning behind them. The only three original features that remained unmodified are \"Time\", \"Amount\", and \"Class\". The feature \"Time\" contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature \"Amount\" represents the transaction amount. Lastly, the feature \"Class\" is the binary response variable that indicates a fraudulent transaction when it is marked as \"1\". \n",

    "Data cleaning is a fundamental step before any data can be used to build a model. The model can only perform well if the data it is trained on can provide valid and material information. This process involves identifying and correcting errors, dealing with missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Removing invalid data points is crucial as it introduces bias towards the model. Outliers may sometimes be considered as a subset of these data points and are considered for removal as it can at times improve the accuracy of the model. However, outliers also often contain information that is desirable for a model to learn. The choice of outlier removal depends on domain specific knowledge. For this reason, in the case of this fraud dataset where for confidentiality reasons almost all of the features are simply PCA components, no data points were removed."

This process not only speeds up model training but also decreases the risk of overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. \n",

The training set is used to train the model, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns in the data. The test set serves as unseen data to evaluate the model's performance, providing an unbiased assessment of the model's ability to generalize on new data. This process helps mitigate overfitting, where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. By partitioning the data and evaluating model performance on a separate test set, we can better estimate how models will perform in real-world scenarios.\n",

Many machine learning algorithms, for various reasons, learn inefficiently and perform suboptimally when trained on unscaled data. For example logistic regression, which is used later on, use gradient descent for optimization. Without scaling, features with large numeric ranges dominate the gradient descent calculations which can lead to slower convergence and suboptimal solutions. Distance based alogorithms like k-nearest neighbors also suffer from unscaled features that disproportionally influence thier distance metric. \n",

Undersampling is a technique used to address class imbalance by reducing the size of the majority class to match the minority class, thereby equalizing their distributions. This approach can improve model performance on the minority class but risks losing potentially valuable information from the majority class due to the removal of data points. Oversampling combats class imbalance by augmenting the minority class through the replication of its data points or generating synthetic samples, aiming to match the size of the majority class. While this method enhances the model's sensitivity to the minority class, it may introduce the risk of overfitting due to the duplication or artificial creation of data.

Logistic regression is powerful when the relationship between the features and the log odds of the response variable is linear. Logistic regression is also favored for its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency, making it an excellent choice for cases where understanding the influence of each feature on the prediction is crucial. However for this scenario interpretibility isn't an important factor. Nonetheless, logistic regression is used in this project particularly for its computation time. \n",

However, some changes to the dataset may be required for this algorithm. Clustering algorithms suffer from something referred to as \"curse of dimensionality\". The performance of clustering algorithms deteriorate with an increase of features due to the sparcity of high-dimensional space.

They are particularly adept at modeling complex, nonlinear relationships and interactions between features due to their hierarchical, divide-and-conquer approach.\n",

Deep learning is most appropriate for applications where the complexity and size of the dataset justify the computational expense, and where the task benefits from the model's ability to learn rich, hierarchical representations of the data.

Consider our current dataset where one class makes up 98.828% of the data available (non-fraudulent transactions).

Unlike model parameters, which are learned from the data during training, hyperparameters are set prior to the training process and can significantly affect model performance. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that results in the best predictive performance on a given task. Common techniques for hyperparameter tuning include grid search, where a set of predefined hyperparameter values are exhaustively tried; random search, which samples hyperparameter combinations at random for a specified number of iterations; and Bayesian optimization, a more sophisticated approach that models the performance function and selects hyperparameters to test based on past results. Effective hyperparameter tuning can lead to significant improvements in model accuracy, efficiency, and generalization to new data.\n",

Unlike grid search or random search, which either exhaustively or randomly explore the hyperparameter space, Bayesian optimization uses prior evaluations of the hyperparameter space to inform the next set of hyperparameters to explore. This probabilistic model approach aims to predict the performance of various hyperparameter combinations and chooses the next evaluation to balance exploration of new areas with exploitation of known promising areas. Bayesian optimization can reach optimal or near-optimal hyperparameter settings faster and with fewer evaluations, making it an especially valuable tool for optimizing complex models where each evaluation can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n",

    "With a highly imbalanced dataset with almost 300,000 credit card transactions, the purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model that could reliably detect fraudulent transactions. The dataset was assumed to be cleaned as the features in this dataset are PCA components of the original for confidentiality reasons. Using a 80/20 split of training/testing data, two classifiers (logistic regression and random forest) were built, trained and tested with F1-score as its evaluation metric. The data was first scaled, then fed into a stratified 5-fold cross-validation using SMOTE to handle the class imbalance and bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. The random forest classifier was found to perform slighly better than the logistic regression model with a F1-score of 0.76. \n",
    "\n",
    "To potentially improve on this classification model, several changes can be made and tried. Firstly, modifications to the dataset can be made. As mentioned earlier, feature selection plays a major factor in model performance. Testing with different subsets of features can improve the model performance and avoid overfitting. Furthermore, changing the sample size of the training data can also improve performance. Currently, the random forest classification model uses all available data points. Because the dataset is so highly imbalanced, using SMOTE may overfit the model to the training data as SMOTE synthetically creates new datapoints by interpolating between fraudulent transactions. A hybrid method of undersampling then oversampling may improve model performance. Furthermore, expanding the search space of the hyperparameters may also improve performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Other learning algorithms may also perform better than the ones that were tested in this project. For example, artificial neural networks (ANN) are very powerful and with tuning are likely to perform better than our current model. However, they are also computationally intensive. These trade-offs must be considered when choosing a learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, my domain knowledge of fraud detection is fairly limited. It's possible that the cost of missing a fraudulent transaction is much more costly than checking if a transaction is fraudulent. In that case, recall can be used as the appropriate evaluation metric. The models can then be tuned for recall instead of F1-score. The evaluation metric should be determined by an understanding of the problem at hand. "
