# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Refer to the "fraud.ipynb" file for details on the project. 

Due to the size of the output graphs in *Section 2: Data Description - Visualizing Features* , the "fraud.ipynb" file becomes too large to host on GitHub (>100mb) and therefore the jupyter notebook was provided without the graphs.

To take a look at the graphs, please open the jupyter notebook and download the dataset from kaggle linked in the notebook in section 1. Change the name of the .csv file to "creditcard.csv" and run all cells up to and including the cell that includes the feature visualization graphs. You may choose to run the entire notebook, however please note that the hyperparameter tuning of the models take some time to run. In total, the entire notebook takes about 30 minutes to run on my M1 Macbook Pro. 

Thanks for reading! :)
